# JSON Web Keys

Handling keys is the most important feature for the security of your applications. This package provides tools to help
you manage them easily.

The [JSON Web Keys standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) defines JSON representations for each
cryptographic key used by JSON Web Algorithms. You may use this representation to easily save and share your keys.

::: warning
This package does not provide tools to securely save and share your keys. It helps you to generate them
using the correct parameters, and provides easy ways to consume them. However, the mediums used to persist and share
those keys are entirely up to you.

::: info The `jwk.Key` type
Key managers are built around the `jwk.Key` format. This is a special struct that can hold both JSON and concrete key
data.

To use the key encoded in a given `jwk.Key` object, just call its `Key()` method. The object can also be directly
marshalled into valid JSON, using the standard `encoding/json` package - or any compatible package.

```go
var jsonKey jwk.Key[T]

// The concrete key, that can be directly used for cryptographic operations.
key := jsonKey.Key()

// Produces a valid JSON out-of-the-box, given it was generated by
// the library.
serialized, _ := json.Marshal(jsonKey)
```
